Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 4.0.1
Stable tag: trunk

Use your email address instead of a username to log into your WordPress.

== Description ==
Use your email address instead of a username to log into your WordPress.

Since email addresses are required to be unique within WordPress anyway, they also make good identifiers for logging in. For slightly better security, set your username to something random and then just forget it and use your email address instead.

Special thanks to:

* r-a-y for compatibility with older versions of WPMU and XML-RPC
* andykillen for introducing translatable strings and the Dutch translation

Translations included for:

* Bengali
* Czech
* Dutch
* Farsi
* Finnish
* French
* German
* Greek
* Hungarian
* Lithuanian
* Persian
* Polish
* Portuguese (Brazil)
* Russian
* Serbian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Turkish


== Installation ==
1. Unzip and upload `/wp-email-login/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Log out, log in again using the email address associated with your WordPress account.
